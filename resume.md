## 🧠 Professional Summary

Versatile systems architect and strategic problem-solver with 26 years in technology and 5 years of military service, known for transforming complex business pain points into streamlined, human-centric solutions. Certified Scrum practitioner since 2015 and proficient in rapid-cycle development using AI-driven workflows, with hands-on experience building agentic automation tools and leading long-term, trusted consulting partnerships.

Embracing a philosophy of empathetic immersion, I specialize in challenging existing systems to build future-proof solutions. My strength lies in identifying friction points, prompting AI coding agents with surgical precision, and building scalable platforms in record time.

Recent breakthroughs include developing swarm agent orchestration for DevOps delivery and rescuing high-risk operations systems for enterprise clients. I leverage tools like Claude Code, Cursor, WindSurf, Python, Visio, and Azure DevOps, but remain tool-agnostic—valuing adaptability and purpose above allegiance.

As automation accelerates and autonomy scales, my vision is rooted in preserving clarity, collaboration, and simplicity—even in complex ecosystems. I believe the future of work is not just lighter—but deeply reimagined.
