# 👋 Hello, I'm Kevin

🧠 Strategic Problem Solver 🔧 Systems Architect 🌌 Explorer of Ideas

---

Welcome to my sandbox.

I design solutions that matter—ones born from empathy, built with precision, and delivered at velocity. With 25 years in tech and 6 years of mission-first military service, I’ve learned that the best systems aren't just functional—they're thoughtful.

I thrive on puzzles, efficiency, and the quiet thrill of transforming pain points into elegant automation. Whether it's orchestrating AI agents or heading into remote wilderness with Starlink and minimalist camping gear, I build and explore with intensity.

My philosophy?  
📍 Challenge complacency  
📍 Adapt rapidly  
📍 Communicate clearly  
📍 Earn trust  
📍 And smile before moving on to the next big challenge

I'm a father of three, a lover of storycraft, maps, and blueprints. If I’m not prompting my way through an LLM build, I might be sketching an imaginary island or writing backstories for anime characters that Copilot helped me bring to life.

This space is my ongoing experiment—where tools like Grok/llama/GPT, MCP tools, and Python CLI scripts intersect with imagination and problem-solving. If you’re curious about automation, character-driven design, or what happens when someone turns curiosity into a career, I invite you to explore.
