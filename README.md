# 👋 Hello, I'm Kevin

🧠 Strategic Problem Solver 🔧 Systems Architect 🌌 Explorer of Ideas

---

Welcome to my sandbox.

I design solutions that matter — ones born from empathy, built with precision, and delivered at velocity. With 25 years in tech and 6 years of mission-first military service, I’ve learned that the best systems aren't just functional — they're thoughtful.

I thrive on puzzles, efficiency, and the quiet thrill of transforming pain points into elegant automation. Whether it's orchestrating AI agents or heading into remote wilderness with Starlink and minimalist camping gear, I build and explore with intensity.

My philosophy:  
📍 Challenge complacency  
📍 Adapt rapidly  
📍 Communicate clearly  
📍 Earn trust  
📍 And smile before moving on to the next big challenge

I'm a father of three, a lover of storycraft, maps, and blueprints. If I’m not prompting my way through an LLM build, I might be sketching an imaginary island or writing backstories for anime characters that Copilot helped me bring to life.

This space is my ongoing experiment—where tools like Grok/llama/GPT, MCP tools, and Python CLI scripts intersect with imagination and problem-solving. If you’re curious about automation, character-driven design, or what happens when someone turns curiosity into a career, I invite you to explore.

## 🔭 What I’m Exploring Now

I'm currently enhancing my Backlog Automation Platform with three ambitious goals:

- 🧪 **Test Case Intelligence for Autonomous QA**  
  I'm refining the structure and clarity of testing work items by embedding detailed testing steps directly into each case. This enables autonomous agents to execute tests with minimal oversight while maintaining high coverage and traceability.

- 🧠 **Swarm Development Agents**  
  I'm designing modular development agents capable of completing user story tasks with complete code management and version control. It's swarm intelligence with real-world engineering standards.

- 🧩 **Autonomous Scrum Leadership**  
  The most familiar yet expansive challenge: building an autonomous Project Manager/Scrum Master agent that oversees development swarm agents and coordinates with a QA Supervisor agent. This orchestration ensures that sprint planning, task allocation, and end-to-end testing are fully autonomous unless a human actor steps in intentionally.

🛠️ **Ultimate Goal:** A fully autonomous Scrum Development Team—human-guided, not human-dependent.
